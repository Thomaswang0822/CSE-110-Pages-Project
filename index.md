A small joke:

In this page I will `def` myself and `return` it to you.

# Introduce Myself
[Here is my photo, which looks better than me =__=](photo.JPG)

My name is Haoxuan Wang, a second-year CS major in Muir college, UCSD. I like playing basketball, going to the gym, playing League of Legends, and recently I start to solve LeetCode challenges. Writing a program basically involves 2 tasks: writing codes and debugging. The first one is like solving a math problem, where you need to come up with many steps that are logically connected before working out your complicated goal. The second one is like solving a case like a detective, where you need to actively look for abnormal behaviors and deduce reasons. These are 2 things I love, so I guess that's why I also love to become a programmer.

First, let me introduce the programming languages I know, from most to least proficient.
1. Python
2. Java
3. C++
4. C
5. JavaScript & HTML & CSS
6. Assembly

Then, I would like to share several most frustrated things I got while debugging.
- Infinite loop, because no error message will show up.
- C++ segfault
- unlucky typos that cannot be identified by your editor.

Up to now, I still have several things to do before I can publish my User Page.
- [x] Figure out how to add section links.
- [x] Add necessay informations besides those markdown elements requried by Lab 1
- [ ] Learn how to publish through Github Pages.
